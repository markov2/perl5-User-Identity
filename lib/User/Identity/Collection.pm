=chapter NAME

User::Identity::Collection - base class for collecting roles of a user

=chapter SYNOPSIS

 use M<User::Identity>;
 use User::Identity::Collection;
 my $me    = User::Identity->new(...);
 my $set   = M<User::Identity::Collection::Emails>->new(...);
 $me->addCollection($set);

 # Simpler
 use User::Identity;
 my $me    = User::Identity->new(...);
 my $set   = $me->addCollection(type => 'email', ...)
 my $set   = $me->addCollection('email', ...)

 my @roles = $me->collection('email');  # list of collected items

 my $coll  = $me->collection('email');  # a User::Identity::Collection
 my @roles = $coll->roles;
 my @roles = @$coll;                    # same, by overloading

 my $role  = $me->collection('email')->find($coderef);
 my $role  = $me->collection('location')->find('work');
 my $role  = $me->find(location => 'work');
 
=chapter DESCRIPTION
The C<User::Identity::Collection> object maintains a set user related
objects.  It helps selecting these objects, which is partially common to
all collections (for instance, each object has a name so you can search
on names), and sometimes specific to the extension of this collection.

Currently imlemented extensions are
=over 4
=item * I<people> is a L<collection of users|User::Identity::Collection::Users>
=item * I<whereabouts> are L<locations|User::Identity::Collection::Locations>
=item * a I<mailinglist> is a
L<collection of email addresses|User::Identity::Collection::Emails>
=item * a I<network> contains
L<groups of systems|User::Identity::Collection::Systems>

=chapter OVERLOADED

=overload stringification 
Returns the name of the collection and a sorted list of defined items.

=examples
 print "$collection\n";  #   location: home, work

=cut

use overload '""' => sub {
   my $self = shift;
   $self->name . ": " . join(", ", sort map {$_->name} $self->roles);
};

=overload  @{}
When the reference to a collection object is used as array-reference, it
will be shown as list of roles.

=examples

 my $locations = $ui->collection('location');
 foreach my $loc (@$location) ...
 print $location->[0];

=cut

use overload '@{}' => sub { [ shift->roles ] };

#-----------------------------------------

=chapter METHODS

=section Constructors
=cut

sub type { "people" }

=c_method new [$name], %options
=requires item_type CLASS
The CLASS which is used to store the information for each of the maintained
objects within this collection.

=option   roles    ROLE|ARRAY
=default  roles    undef

Immediately add some roles to this collection.  In case of an ARRAY,
each element of the array is passed separately to M<addRole()>. So,
you may end-up with an ARRAY of arrays each grouping a set of options
to create a role.

=cut

sub init($)
{   my ($self, $args) = @_;

    defined($self->SUPER::init($args)) or return;
    
    $self->{UIC_itype} = delete $args->{item_type} or die;
    tie %{$self->{UIC_roles}}, 'Hash::Ordered';
    my $roles = $args->{roles};
 
    my @roles
     = ! defined $roles      ? ()
     : ref $roles eq 'ARRAY' ? @$roles
     :                         $roles;
 
    $self->addRole($_) foreach @roles;
    $self;
}

#-----------------------------------------

=section Attributes

=method roles 
Returns all defined roles within this collection.  Be warned: the rules
are returned in random (hash) order.
=cut

sub roles() { values %{shift->{UIC_roles}} }

=method itemType 
Returns the type of the items collected.
=cut

sub itemType { shift->{UIC_itype} }

#-----------------------------------------

=section Maintaining roles

=method addRole $role| <[$name],%options> | ARRAY

Adds a new role to this collection.  $role is an object of the right type
(depends on the extension of this module which type that is) or a list
of %options which are used to create such role.  The options can also be
passed as reference to an ARRAY.  The added role is returned.

=examples
 my $uicl = User::Identity::Collection::Locations->new;

 my $uil  = User::Identity::Location->new(home => ...);
 $uicl->addRole($uil);

 $uicl->addRole( home => address => 'street 32' );
 $uicl->addRole( [home => address => 'street 32'] );

Easier

 $ui      = User::Identity;
 $ui->add(location => 'home', address => 'street 32' );
 $ui->add(location => [ 'home', address => 'street 32' ] );

=error Wrong type of role for $collection: requires a $expect but got a $type
Each $collection groups sets of roles of one specific type ($expect).  You
cannot add objects of a different $type.

=error Cannot create a $type to add this to my collection.
Some options are specified to create a $type object, which is native to
this collection.  However, for some reason this failed.

=cut

sub addRole(@)
{   my $self = shift;
    my $maintains = $self->itemType;

    my $role;
    if(ref $_[0] && ref $_[0] ne 'ARRAY')
    {   $role = shift;
        croak "ERROR: Wrong type of role for ".ref($self)
            . ": requires a $maintains but got a ". ref($role)
           unless $role->isa($maintains);
    }
    else
    {   $role = $maintains->new(ref $_[0] ? @{$_[0]} :  @_);
        croak "ERROR: Cannot create a $maintains to add this to my collection."
            unless defined $role;
    }

    $role->parent($self);
    $self->{UIC_roles}{$role->name} = $role;
    $role;
}

=method removeRole $role|$name
The deleted role is returned (if it existed).
=cut

sub removeRole($)
{   my ($self, $which) = @_;
    my $name = ref $which ? $which->name : $which;
    my $role = delete $self->{UIC_roles}{$name} or return ();
    $role->parent(undef);
    $role;
}

=method renameRole <$role|$oldname>, $newname
Give the role a different name, and move it in the collection.

=error Cannot rename $name into $newname: already exists
=error Cannot rename $name into $newname: doesn't exist
=cut

sub renameRole($$$)
{   my ($self, $which, $newname) = @_;
    my $name = ref $which ? $which->name : $which;

    if(exists $self->{UIC_roles}{$newname})
    {   $self->log(ERROR=>"Cannot rename $name into $newname: already exists");
        return ();
    }

    my $role = delete $self->{UIC_roles}{$name};
    unless(defined $role)
    {   $self->log(ERROR => "Cannot rename $name into $newname: doesn't exist");
        return ();
    }

    $role->name($newname);   # may imply change other attributes.
    $self->{UIC_roles}{$newname} = $role;
}

=method sorted 
Returns the roles sorted by name, alphabetically and case-sensitive.
=cut

sub sorted() { sort {$a->name cmp $b->name} shift->roles}

#-----------------------------------------

=section Searching

=method find $name|CODE|undef
Find the object with the specified $name in this collection.  With C<undef>,
a randomly selected role is returned.

When a code reference is specified, all collected roles are scanned one
after the other (in unknown order).  For each role,

 CODE->($object, $collection)

is called.  When the CODE returns true, the role is selected.  In list context,
all selected roles are returned.  In scalar context, the first match is
returned and the scan is aborted immediately.

=examples

 my $emails = $ui->collection('emails');
 $emails->find('work');

 sub find_work($$) {
    my ($mail, $emails) = @_;
    $mail->location->name eq 'work';
 }
 my @at_work = $emails->find(\&find_work);
 my @at_work = $ui->find(location => \&find_work);
 my $any     = $ui->find(location => undef );

=cut

sub find($)
{   my ($self, $select) = @_;

      !defined $select ? ($self->roles)[0]
    : !ref $select     ? $self->{UIC_roles}{$select}
    : wantarray        ? grep ({ $select->($_, $self) } $self->roles)
    :                    first { $select->($_, $self) } $self->roles;
}
